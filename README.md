## General Technologies
(roughly speaking)
- IoT: Rachel, Ashwin, Zach
- AI: Melody, Ashwin
- Security/AAD: Ana, Aayushi
- App: Ana
- Data/Storage: Rachel, Zach, Aayushi

## Basic idea:
- there is an IoT device
- IoT device has sensor that sends data
- Data is stored somewhere
- Data is processed with AI to create recommendations
- Users login to see their specific data
- Users use app via web
- Data is fitness app data (i.e. steps, heart sensor)

## Timeline
- Research above technologies
- Create (more detailed) Project Plan/Steps
- Hack

## Project Steps
##### (very, very roughly speaking, more to be added)
###### (question marks are when I have 0 idea of what I am talking about, and haven't done research to know what actual steps are)
1. App
    1. Create Skeleton App
    2. Create login permissions (aka create users)
    3. Connect to database
    4. Read from database / read only specific user data
2. AI
    1. Process data (?)
    2. Train data (?)
    3. Create predictions (?)
3. IoT
    1. IoT device setup (?)
    2. Send data to database (?)
    3. Connect user-specific data (?)
4. Storage
    1. Create database
    2. Connect to app
    3. Assign to various users (?)
    4. Process/manage data (?)
